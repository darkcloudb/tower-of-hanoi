# Tower of Hanoi

Follow the instructions on my.kenzie.academy to complete the assignment.

Notes:

Lets do christmas colors for holidays

{
display: flex;  
 flex-direction: column-reverse;  
 align-items: center;
}

we want 4 'width' disks
smallest - red 50px
small - yellow 80px
medium - blue 120px
large - orange 180px

Z axis for stacking the blocks and towers

I think we are supposed to append the towers and the blocks and not use CSS

Current Questions:
Is it only picking up the top-most block first?
When dropped, will it go to bottom?
Position of blocks does not adjust with screen size.
Perhaps we do clickhandler on disk to pick up
Clickhandler on tower to drop
